### Metadata information


Here is a table including the flower evolution in the time, like a type of flower calendar.

The first column is named stalk_number, the first number is the stalk id and the second one corresponds to the flower id (separed by corresponding stalk). The combination resulting is the global flower id.

The day_birth means the day when the floral envelope opens. I have considered the birth day as the day when a petal take off of the others.

The day_death means the day when the floral envelope closes. I have considered the death day as the day when a folded petal cut the central axis of symmetry.

### Analysis



## flower evolution

I have taken measurements during the flower "life time". That means from the birth day to the death day (see flower calendar for more explanations)

```{r}
a <- chart(flower_evo, petal_lg ~ age_day %col=% flower) + geom_point()

b <- chart(flower_evo, male_lg ~ age_day %col=% flower) + geom_point()

c <- chart(flower_evo, fml_lg ~ age_day %col=% flower) + geom_point()

combine_charts(list(a,b,c))
```
